# Template Maker
_V.2._

I redid the original template maker with some significant changes. First, I have restructured the code to work on an object-oriented basis to simplify storing questions, answers and solving methods. Furthermore, I switched the document dependency from fpdf to pyLaTeX, primarily due to preference and simplicity. This would allow easy integration with LaTeX's handle on formulas, graphs, tables, and equations. I hope this is useful to someone making worksheets or practice problems for their students.

## Dependencies
* pylatex
* random
